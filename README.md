## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/evgvol/read_more.git
```
2. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

3. Add the following environment variables to the .env file:
```
SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-51ydgsn!flww^)=p+m5rkp=bpan@q*em8#u^40s^4ug94l6_j('
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1, localhost, web
EMAIL_HOST_USER='your-email@yandex.ru'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your-password'
EMAIL_ADMIN='your-email@yandex.ru'
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_NAME=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres 
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
REDIS_HOST='127.0.0.1'
REDIS_PORT=6379
YANDEX_KEY='yandex-key'
YANDEX_SECRET='yandex-secret'
GOOGLE_KEY='google-key'
GOOGLE_SECRET='google-secret'
VK_KEY='vk-key'
VK_SECRET='vk-secret'
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY='github-key'
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET='github-secret'
```

4. Navigate to the project directory using:
```
cd backend
```

5. Install the dependencies using the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6.  Start the Redis using the following command:
```
docker pull redis
docker run -it --rm --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

7. Start the Django development server using the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver --settings=website.settings.local

#If you need a SSL using the command below:
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file cert.crt
```

8. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the application.


9. To add translations of your source code, use the following command:
```
python manage.py makemessages --all
```
10. Edit `django.po` files in the locale folder of each application using a text editor. After that, run the following command to compile translations:
```
python manage.py compilemessages
```

## SERVER SETUP

1. Connect to your server via SSH, if you haven't already done so, and update the APT package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Now update the packages installed in the system and install security updates:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

3. Install the Russian localization using the built-in dpkg-reconfigure utility

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales 
```

4. Restart the server:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

5. Next, install the necessary PostgreSQL packages:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y
```

6. You can manage the database server using standard systemd commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgresql # Stop 
sudo systemctl start postgresql # Start
sudo systemctl restart postgresql # Restart
sudo systemctl status postgresql # Find out status, current status
```

7. On the command line, on behalf of the postgres user, call the psql utility, this is a client program for connecting and managing a DBMS:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

8. Now, through psql, create a db_name database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
# Upon successful creation, CREATE DATABASE will return
```

9. Create a user registration record on the database server, then inform Django about this user's data (his username and password). As a result, Django will get access to the database under this name:

```bash
# Ð¡reate a db_user user and come up with your password, more complicated than in the example
CREATE USER db_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'xxxyyyzzz'; 
# give the db_user user all rights when working with the db_name database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE db_name TO db_user;  
```

10. Configure access to PostgreSQL:

Make sure that PostgreSQL allows remote connection if necessary. Edit the pg_hba.conf file, which is located in /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf to allow remote connections if they are required.

11. Configure PostgreSQL settings:

Change the PostgreSQL settings in the postgresql.conf file, which is located in /etc/postgresql/version/main/postgresql.conf. Some parameters that you may need to configure include listen_addresses, max_connections, and others depending on your needs.

12. After making changes, restart PostgreSQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

13. Install Redis:

You can install Redis on Ubuntu using the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```

14. After the installation is complete, start the Redis service and enable it to start on boot:

```bash
udo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```

15. Configure Redis (Optional):

By default, Redis is configured to bind to localhost. If you want to allow external connections or make other configuration changes, you can edit the Redis configuration file at /etc/redis/redis.conf.

```bash
bind 0.0.0.0
```

16. Make sure that Redis is really running on the server. You can use the following command to check:

```bash
redis-cli -h 001.222.333.444 -p 6379 ping
#  If the connection is successful, PONG will return
```
